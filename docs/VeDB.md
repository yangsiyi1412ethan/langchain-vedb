VeDB is a distributed relational database.
It is developed entirely by ByteDanceâ€™s database group.

VeDB currently supports storing vector data, and users can easily make use of the following capabilities via SQL:

- Create tables with vector type columns
- Create approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) indexes
- Perform similarity search based on vectors
- ...

## Installation

pip install -U langchain-vedb
